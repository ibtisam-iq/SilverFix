# SilverFix - My Troubleshooting Vault
*My journey of breaking, fixing, and learning ‚Äî one case at a time.*

Welcome to **SilverFix** üéâ  
This repository is my personal log of real-world troubleshooting cases that I face in my DevOps journey.  

I started my DevOps learning journey about **two years ago**, but I began documenting my troubleshooting only now. That means many challenges I solved in the past may not be recorded here ‚Äî but from this point forward, I‚Äôll be capturing as much as possible.  

The goal is simple: to transform my daily debugging and troubleshooting into a **structured, searchable, and reusable knowledge base**. Every fix, every insight, every "aha!" moment deserves to be written down.

## Case Format

Each troubleshooting case in this repo follows the same structure:

Include commands, settings, or configurations.

## Objective

The purpose of **SilverFix** is to:

* Capture my **daily troubleshooting journey** as a DevOps engineer.
* Document not only the **fixes**, but also the **learnings and realizations** that come with them.
* Build a **personal treasure chest of solutions** that will help me (and hopefully others) in the future.

This is my **living vault of fixes and learnings** üí°
What started late will only grow stronger from here üöÄ
